This simplified but detailed pipeline shows:

1. Input Processing:
- Takes raw Mermaid code
- Parses into structured format
- Generates Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

2. Layout Optimization:
- Analyzes node spacing and relationships
- Optimizes edge routing to minimize crossings
- Balances hierarchical structures

3. Style Enhancement:
- LLM assists with:
  - Color scheme generation
  - Typography choices
  - Visual hierarchy decisions
- Unifies styling across elements

4. Output Generation:
- Produces optimized SVG
- Supports multiple export formats
- Maintains quality standards

The key difference from standard Mermaid rendering is the introduction of the LLM-powered style engine and sophisticated layout optimization. This provides a middle ground between basic Mermaid output and full professional illustration tools.
