1. Input Layer:
- Start with an expanded DSL that builds on Mermaid's strengths but addresses its limitations
- Could include natural language processing to allow more flexible input formats
- Support for semantic relationships and hierarchies beyond what Mermaid offers

2. Intelligence Layer:
- Use LLMs to understand the semantic meaning of the diagram
- Automatically suggest improvements to layout and organization
- Learn from existing academic papers to apply field-specific conventions

3. Style Layer:
- Maintain a vector database of professional diagrams to learn from
- Use AI to understand and apply consistent styling
- Generate multiple style variations for user selection

4. Rendering Layer:
- SVG-first approach for maximum flexibility
- Built-in support for academic paper requirements (resolution, file formats)
- Automated layout optimization

Key innovations this could offer:
- Automatic enhancement of basic diagrams to professional quality
- Style transfer from existing papers in the same field
- Semantic understanding to suggest better layouts
- Consistent styling without manual effort

The main technical challenges would be:
- Creating a flexible enough DSL that's still user-friendly
- Training the LLMs to understand diagram semantics
- Developing a robust layout engine that produces publication-quality results
- Ensuring consistent style application across different types of diagrams
