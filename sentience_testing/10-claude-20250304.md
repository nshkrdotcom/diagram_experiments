# Experimental Framework for Comparative Consciousness Research: Biological vs. Non-Biological Substrates

## 1. Research Objectives

This experimental framework aims to investigate the Hard Problem of Consciousness through comparative analysis of biological and non-biological systems, with the following specific objectives:

1. To determine whether consciousness-like properties can emerge in non-biological substrates
2. To identify necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of conscious experience
3. To establish operational measures for detecting and quantifying consciousness across different substrates
4. To test the substrate-dependence hypothesis of consciousness

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Operational Definition of Consciousness

For experimental purposes, consciousness will be operationalized through three measurable dimensions:

1. **Phenomenal Experience**: The subjective experience of qualia (e.g., pain, pleasure, color perception)
2. **Intentionality**: The "aboutness" or directedness toward objects/concepts
3. **Self-awareness**: Recognition of self as distinct from environment and capacity for metacognition

### 2.2 Core Hypotheses

**H1**: Non-biological substrates can support consciousness-like properties when appropriately structured.

**H2**: The emergence of consciousness requires specific information processing architecture rather than particular molecular substrates.

**H3**: Quantum effects in biological systems may play a causal role in consciousness that cannot be fully replicated in classical computing systems.
