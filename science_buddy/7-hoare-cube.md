# Hoare Cube

## [The Hoare Cube](https://johnwickerson.wordpress.com/2024/12/04/the-hoare-cube/)

The Hoare Cube, as described by John Wickerson's blog post and derived from Cousot's work, offers a fascinating framework for understanding program correctness and its various interpretations.  While seemingly distant from the goal of finding groundbreaking scientific truths, there are some intriguing connections and potential parallels worth exploring.

**Key Connections and Insights:**

1. **Exploring Different Perspectives (Logics):** The Hoare Cube represents different program logics, each with its own perspective on correctness (partial correctness, reverse Hoare logic, necessary preconditions, etc.). This resonates with the idea of exploring different scientific narratives or hypotheses, each offering a partial or potentially biased view of the underlying truth.  The "toggling" of semantic switches in the Hoare Cube is analogous to shifting between different scientific paradigms, theoretical frameworks, or experimental setups. Each setting reveals a different facet of the system being studied, much like how each program logic highlights a specific aspect of program behavior.

2. **Duality and Synthesis:**  The cube highlights dualities, like correctness vs. incorrectness, forward vs. backward reasoning, over- vs. under-approximation.  These dualities have parallels in scientific inquiry:  theory vs. experiment, inductive vs. deductive reasoning, confirmation vs. falsification.  The search for scientific truth often involves synthesizing opposing or complementary perspectives, much like how the Hoare Cube connects different logics through transformations and bijections.  For example, the duality between forward and backward reasoning (represented by *c* and *c⁻¹*) could correspond to exploring a scientific phenomenon through both prediction (forward) and explanation (backward).  This approach resembles causal reasoning where we try to establish the relationships both forward and backward between cause and effect, and could potentially enhance multi-agent exploration if agents are assigned to explore opposing edges to determine which agents are converging with respect to some objective truth or perhaps even using the convergence process itself to identify new, non-intuitive edges or connections where these concepts become causal, i.e. by using their gradients for some reward metric using a gradient descent or other optimization technique across the narrative hyperspace, where truth is found at the extrema of some target causal function and where those causal relationships are deemed valid only if they can be reproduced in an orthogonal, independent manner where similar types of systems or simulations converge towards some shared truth, and where those truths become represented as knowledge within the network or narrative to augment the overall discovery process in this manner using various metrics like chirality scores to measure the degree of convergence and therefore the quality of truth (for instance) or other relevant measures that emerge as the system develops through training in whatever specific application is being investigated or simulated using this technique etc.


3. **Formal Framework and Transformations:** The Hoare Cube provides a *formal* framework for relating different logics.  This is crucial for your overall goal of building a rigorous pipeline. Formalizing scientific narratives, their relationships, and the concept of "truth" is essential for developing a robust automated system.  The bijections between different vertices of the cube suggest the possibility of transforming one scientific narrative into another, potentially revealing hidden connections or resolving inconsistencies.

4. **Navigating a Complex Space:**  The cube represents a complex space of possibilities, analogous to the vast and intricate landscape of scientific knowledge.  Navigating this space effectively requires efficient exploration strategies.  The connections and transformations within the Hoare Cube offer inspiration for how to explore the "hypothesis space" in your system.

**Connecting to the Bigger Picture:**

Here's how these insights can inform your research pipeline for finding scientific truths:

1. **Formalizing Narratives:**  Draw inspiration from the formal logic of the Hoare Cube. Develop a rigorous way to represent scientific narratives, their relationships (chiral, orthogonal, or other), and the concept of "truth."  This could involve using formal logic, knowledge graphs, or other symbolic representations to ensure the consistent interpretation and use of scientific facts, for example using ontologies from specific knowledge domains, where concepts are more easily defined as assertions relative to each other with properties such as those that define chirality or orthogonality etc.


2. **Exploring Transformations:**  Investigate how to transform one scientific narrative into another, similar to the bijections in the Hoare Cube.  This could involve changing the level of abstraction, shifting perspectives, or reframing the narrative in a different theoretical framework. This exploration may reveal connections between seemingly distinct narratives or scientific domains and/or discover contradictions or other types of inconsistencies.

3. **Multi-Agent Exploration:** Your multi-agent system can explore different "facets" of the hypothesis space, analogous to the different vertices of the Hoare Cube.  Agents can specialize in different types of reasoning (inductive, deductive, abductive), different scientific domains, or different levels of abstraction.  They could use the formal framework developed to derive proofs of correctness between opposing or related narratives if such structures were amenable, or by quantifying these proofs using other metrics like those proposed for evaluating or comparing their quality based on some measure of distance from a known or predicted truth embedding, where those predictions converge in an orthogonal and independently verifiable way to suggest some fundamental truth exists, or if they diverge or conflict could provide feedback to the model developers to further refine those more fundamental, underlying theoretical constructs themselves as they incorporate these new insights, or even discover new research directions from those results.


4. **Dynamic Selection and Synthesis:**  The dynamic selection of chiral pairs in your previous approach can be generalized. Agents can dynamically select narratives to explore or synthesize based on their current understanding of the "truth landscape"  and the relationships between narratives.


The Hoare Cube provides a valuable analogy and a source of inspiration for designing a pipeline for scientific discovery.  While not a direct blueprint, it highlights the importance of formal frameworks, exploring different perspectives, and synthesizing dualities in the search for truth. By incorporating these insights into your research, you can develop a more robust, efficient, and potentially groundbreaking approach to automated scientific discovery using your novel techniques and multi-agent reinforcement learning systems with chiral or other emergent, yet to be discovered network topologies.
