# Github Search Strat

I can offer a strategy for *your* search and suggest some general categories of projects you're likely to encounter, along with examples of keywords and potential repositories (which you'll have to verify and update).

**Search Strategy on GitHub:**

1. **Keyword Permutations:** Use various combinations of keywords related to your research area:
    *   "automated scientific discovery"
    *   "hypothesis generation AI"
    *   "knowledge graph science"
    *   "multi-agent reinforcement learning science"
    *   "chiral networks" (and variations of this, although it's less likely to yield direct hits)
    *   "narrative generation research"
    *   "scientific reasoning AI"
    *   "knowledge synthesis"
    *   Combine these with specific scientific domains (e.g., "drug discovery," "material science")
2. **Filters:** Use GitHub's advanced search filters:
    *   Language (e.g., Python, Java)
    *   Stars (to find popular projects)
    *   Date updated (to find actively maintained projects)
    *   License (e.g., open-source licenses)
3. **Explore Related Projects:** When you find a relevant repository, explore its network of related projects (e.g., forked repositories, repositories that link to it). This can uncover hidden gems.
4. **Explore Trending Repositories:** Check GitHub's trending repositories within relevant topics (e.g., machine learning, artificial intelligence, scientific computing).  This may help you discover interesting and rapidly developing open source projects.
5. **Use Google (or another general search engine) to Search GitHub:** Use this structure for queries:  `site:github.com "your keywords"`


**Potential Categories and Example Repositories (Please Verify):**

Remember, these are just *potential* examples.  You *must* verify their relevance and find more up-to-date repositories through your own search.

**1. Automated Scientific Discovery Platforms:**

*   **Potential Keywords:** "automated science," "hypothesis generation platform," "AI-driven discovery"
*   **Example (Hypothetical):**  `auto-science-platform` (This is a placeholder – you'll need to find actual repositories) – A platform for automating the scientific method, including hypothesis generation, experimental design, and data analysis.


**2. Knowledge Graph Construction and Reasoning:**

*   **Potential Keywords:** "knowledge graph construction," "scientific knowledge graph," "knowledge representation reasoning"
*   **Example (Hypothetical):** `science-knowledge-graph` – Tools and methods for building and querying knowledge graphs of scientific information.

**3. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Science:**

*   **Potential Keywords:** "multi-agent reinforcement learning," "MARL science," "agent-based scientific modeling"
*   **Example (Hypothetical):**  `MARL-for-drug-discovery`  –  A multi-agent RL framework for drug discovery or other related problem, using multi-agent RL, e.g. with chiral features.


**4. Narrative Generation and Analysis:**

*   **Potential Keywords:** "narrative generation," "story generation AI," "narrative understanding"
*   **Example (Hypothetical):** `narrative-science-generator` –  Tools for generating narratives from graphs, ontologies or other representational structure.



**5. Specific Scientific Domain Tools (e.g., Drug Discovery):**

*   **Potential Keywords:** "drug discovery AI," "molecule generation," "protein folding prediction"
*   **Examples (Hypothetical):**  `AI-drug-design`, `protein-folding-predictor`


**Important Notes:**

*   **Verify and Update:** The examples above are purely hypothetical.  You must conduct your own search to find real and relevant repositories.
*   **No Guarantees:** There's no guarantee that you'll find a project that exactly matches your vision.  However, exploring related projects can provide valuable insights and tools you can adapt.
*   **Look Beyond Code:**  Pay attention to the documentation, publications, and discussions associated with the repositories. These can provide valuable context and insights.

By using this strategy and focusing your search, you can uncover relevant GitHub projects that can inform and inspire your research, even without direct access to a comprehensive, real-time search of GitHub's vast repository of code and knowledge.
