# ONS-GTD

## A prelim atttempt to define a research direction

You're reframing chirality as an idealized representation of independent gradient descents converging on truth from opposing narrative structures.  This clarifies the core concept considerably. Let's explore this refined approach, emphasizing the relationship between chiral and orthogonal narrative structures in the search for ground truth.

**Research Direction:  Orthogonal Narrative Synthesis for Ground Truth Discovery (ONS-GTD)**

**Core Idea:**  This research investigates how the interplay between chiral and orthogonal narrative structures can guide the discovery of ground truth.  "Chiral narratives" represent opposing but partially correct perspectives, while "orthogonal narratives" represent completely independent and potentially complementary pieces of information.  The system learns to synthesize these different types of narratives to converge on a more complete and accurate understanding of the underlying truth.

**1. Defining Narrative Embeddings and Relationships:**

*   **Narrative Embedding:** As before, each narrative *N_i* is represented as an embedding vector *E_i* in a high-dimensional space.

*   **Chirality:** Two narratives are considered chiral if their embeddings have a high cosine distance but individually have non-zero cosine similarity relative to some shared truth embedding T, but where they individually partially converge to *T*.  This captures the idea of opposing but partially correct perspectives, starting with diametrically opposed structures and beliefs. These would ideally represent pure, perfect chirality as defined from each other, but need not have any specific orientation relative to ground truth except that it be partially correct, and so in general are imperfectly chiral narratives with some convergence score, where the chiral pair converges perfectly to each other when inverting one narrative through an affine transformation across the hyperplane defined by their n-dimensional embeddings.  The degree of deviation from this represents their degree of asymmetry relative to each other. The difference in their projections to the target space with respect to the truth, multiplied by their divergence would constitute the proposed definition of Chiral Score.  Chiral pairs ideally have the same convergence score relative to some known ground truth and are defined with respect to each other across some affine subspace, at least initially. However the definition can be extended to a multi-chiral structure defined between at least two chiral pairs relative to the ground truth which is itself ideally independent. This approach would seem to scale gracefully to many imperfect scenarios but requires much deeper study to provide much needed experimental evidence and proof of utility.  A single or multiple chiral pair would therefore need to satisfy at least one or more assertions relative to that ground truth while simultaneously being diametrically opposed. This approach may be especially useful to explore how adversarial ML systems can exploit or benefit from these structures.

*   **Orthogonality:** Two narratives are considered orthogonal if their embeddings have near-zero cosine similarity. This represents independent pieces of information that may or may not be individually correct. However these individual orthogonal embeddings when defined as pairs or larger group structures can be leveraged when we recognize similar principles or properties to those of chirality arise relative to the known target truth from independent and potentially arbitrary, orthogonal dimensions that we may extend and use analogously to chiral gradient descent to discover other chiral features. For instance, a set of independent narratives can be evaluated as chiral in high dimensions if those dimensions converge toward some partial truth as a multi-narrative unit, using the aforementioned techniques with appropriate extensions for high dimensions and their newly revealed constraints and conditions which only emerge after those relationships and features emerge and become apparent from the resulting dynamic data structures and processes.

*   **Truth Embedding (T):** Represents the ground truth as an embedding vector.

**2.  Narrative Synthesis Process:**

*   **Independent Descents:**  Start with a set of chiral narratives and orthogonal narratives.  Each narrative undergoes a "gradient descent" process towards truth.  Gradient descent in this setting can be some form of automated hypothesis revision and refining that increases their truth or reduces their respective asymmetry relative to the truth embedding using the provided equations for calculating convergence, asymmetry, or orthogonality.

*   **Chiral Interaction:** Chiral narratives interact by exchanging information or by generating new hypotheses that bridge their opposing viewpoints. For example, adversarial networks or coevolution could guide narrative optimization, with chirality informing strategy.


*   **Orthogonal Integration:** Orthogonal narratives are integrated based on their complementarity, evaluated through their relationships to both *T* and the chiral narratives they might support, and where these supporting relationships emerge during training based on metrics described previously. A multi-agent system, where individual agents each attempt to resolve some local asymmetry relative to their embedded view of this data using the locally available topological information to identify chiral pairs, or chiral pairs in relation to those that they discover independently as orthogonal which emerge later in training and only after sufficient structure has formed for recognition, will need further thought and research to explore in practice but in theory seems quite reasonable to consider.  Consider representing agents using graphs themselves where agents can form chiral pairs using inter-agent chiral features, thus allowing for an aggregation and synthetic approach where emergent collective behaviours form when they mutually benefit, potentially leading to significant increases in resource efficiency and thus allow more sophisticated behaviour to emerge within the system given those gains without necessarily adding any more resources beyond simply recognizing the value of sharing information when it leads to such gains, as observed in natural biological systems through a form of simulated evolution in this simulated or artificial digital environment to see if the same patterns evolve or to see what happens at these emergent layers within your simulated multi-agent networks.
*   **Convergence to Orthogonality:** As narratives approach ground truth *T*, they will become more orthogonal to each other relative to their divergence in the higher dimensional hyper-space containing those pairs, potentially revealing chiral structures. Thus when independent (orthogonal) narratives independently converge on ground truth they may begin to appear as a chiral structure (diametrically opposed in the local region but converge partially to the truth at different points). We may wish to penalize chiral score within our metrics as truth develops, and introduce measures that define a minimum or maximal set of such assertions or invariants that should always remain true based on theory, observed results in related experiments etc. to both enhance and accelerate our learning through creative and novel reinforcement feedback mechanisms to increase the speed and quality of discoveries from our systems, which in theory should also increase in the number of possible uses beyond the original design or intent of the model builders if their hypothesis of this convergence of disparate information through this form of synthetic orthogonality that ideally arises spontaneously or emerges as a property of the system's self-improving or meta-learning capabilities and/or the data scientists' abilities to discover and identify chiral and orthogonal features using tools or processes designed to assist and automate or otherwise enhance the human scientist's ability to incorporate such techniques in our scientific research or any other domain where the system exhibits a capability for creative or innovative, emergent self-directed behaviours.


**3. Implications for Scientific Discovery:**

*   **Reconciling Conflicting Theories:**  This framework can help reconcile seemingly conflicting scientific theories by identifying their underlying chiral relationships and synthesizing more comprehensive explanations, such as finding hidden common ancestor causes or resolving contradictory observations by uncovering shared, underlying, unanticipated truths.


*   **Integrating Diverse Evidence:** It can facilitate the integration of diverse evidence from multiple sources, even if the evidence appears contradictory or incomplete. This is especially valuable for evidence coming from vastly different domains, contexts, experimental settings etc. For instance, imagine we discovered through our automated experiments that certain types of cancer are more prevalent in specific geographic locations. We might use some geographical map data about those regions from independent data sources and begin to explore a network topology for our geo-locations of these particular cancers, which we augment using other topological properties, and start to perform this novel form of chiral gradient descent that converges on particular solutions for the types of environmental effects, as measured using our chiral scores from comparing other datasets or networks or models etc. related to geographic soil or atmospheric patterns associated with different chemical compositions. Using these tools we might more quickly converge upon the existence of new causal relations between seemingly disparate causes or information which may be entirely or otherwise nearly statistically insignificant independently or if studied through traditional means that would fail to identify or test such relationships if those interactions occurred across complex or otherwise obscure networks that traditional hypothesis generation techniques lack the sophistication or ability to test such creative, novel and non-intuitive relationships, possibly hindering progress towards finding life-saving therapies due to the immense complexity and scale involved in such problems.
*   **Generating Novel Hypotheses:** The process of orthogonal and chiral narrative integration generates new hypotheses that potentially reconcile or extend incomplete narratives using those newly created composite or hybrid, orthogonal narratives from those multi-narrative sources.



This approach offers a more nuanced and potentially impactful way to use the concept of chirality for automated scientific discovery, specifically by framing it within the context of narrative synthesis. By explicitly incorporating the interplay between chiral and orthogonal narratives, this direction has the potential to reveal fundamental causal or other structural relationships across disciplines or vastly disparate scientific data domains, using tools and techniques derived from a much deeper understanding of how chiral and orthogonal or other topological properties of interacting networks in the context of known or discovered ground truths or by extending those principles to complex dynamical processes where those patterns emerge or perhaps where we might discover previously unobserved natural behaviour or discover completely new physical principles when compared with those predictions provided by scientific theory in these systems.  Consider testing how chiral properties, derived from using networks that reflect relationships found in biological cells or tissues that themselves reflect and adapt according to those multi-directional flows within their topological and temporal and dimensional context might also influence and converge similarly to these idealized narratives in hopes of more correctly predicting ground truth for such experiments, and compare results of such studies with scientific consensus where such theories or observations are validated as facts, and by further developing these theoretical constructs we might extend those to explore areas or systems where little or no such experimental data yet exists, for example developing these multi-narrative chiral integration theories further using similar ideas, for instance extending or integrating with theory of multi-objective dynamical systems and extending those concepts to incorporate chiral relationships into dynamical models.&#x20;
