# Terence Tao on AI Driven Math Research

Here's a breakdown of methods and ideas from the transcript, focusing on automated mathematical discovery and enhancements for your project (ACD, file 33), along with new, inspired methods:

**Methods and Ideas from the Transcript:**

1. **"Data Scarcity" Problem (for AI in Math):**  Professor Tao highlights that AI excels with abundant data (like IMO problems) but struggles with "research-level" problems where data is scarce. This reinforces the need for human-AI collaboration in ACD, where humans provide the initial intuitions and guide exploration in data-sparse regions. Consider generating synthetic training data for these data-scarce scenarios to help bootstrap models or use methods like transfer learning where models trained on related but data-rich problems can provide initial weightings to accelerate learning in data-scarce domains.

2. **Formal Proof Verification as Essential:**  The consensus is that formal proof verification (e.g., using Lean) is crucial for ensuring the correctness of AI-generated mathematical work. This strengthens the justification for integrating a formal proof assistant into ACD, as described in your "Future Directions."  Consider how formal methods might also be integrated into your "narrative structures" framework.  Could narratives themselves be represented in a formal language amenable to automated verification, and how would properties like chirality and orthogonality be expressed in that context?

3. **Modularization and Specialization of Roles:** Professor Tao's analogy of a film crew (with specialized roles) applies to ACD's multi-agent system. Agents could specialize in pattern recognition, conjecture generation, code generation (EADS), formal proof verification, literature search, and even generating counterexamples. This specialization could improve efficiency and enable the system to tackle more complex mathematical problems.  How might this specialization be achieved?  Could different agents use specialized neural network architectures, different training data, or different reinforcement learning algorithms?  Could meta-learning be used to dynamically adjust the roles of agents based on the current state of the problem?

4. **Generating "Synthetic" Data (Including Failed Proofs):** Professor Tao suggests the value of generating synthetic data, including "failed proofs" as training data for AIs. This is a novel idea that could enhance the robustness of ACD.  EADS could be used to generate not only code to test conjectures but also to generate variations of proofs, including incorrect or incomplete proofs, to train the LLM on a wider range of mathematical reasoning.  How can "failure" be formally defined in the context of mathematical proof?  Could we use metrics like logical inconsistencies, counterexamples, or deviations from established proof strategies to characterize "failed proofs"?

5. **Iterative Refinement with AI Feedback:** The example of a classroom where the instructor corrects a proof in real-time illustrates a powerful learning process.  In ACD, a similar iterative refinement loop could be implemented where the LLM proposes conjectures, EADS generates tests, and the human user provides feedback. This feedback loop could be formalized within the reinforcement learning framework, where the human feedback acts as a reward or penalty signal, dynamically adjusting how the LLMs and EADS combine and or are refined and or how some property like our chirality/orthogonality emerges relative to that truth based embedding or fact that the system is meant to converge on for this particular type of scientific inquiry, experiment, or research objective?


**New Inspired Methods:**

1. **Aesthetic-Driven Conjecture Generation:**  Mark Chen mentions the "aesthetic" of mathematics. While hard to formalize, could we incorporate some measure of "mathematical elegance" or "simplicity" into the fitness function of the evolutionary algorithm?  This could guide ACD toward conjectures that are not just correct but also aesthetically pleasing or intuitively appealing, reflecting the criteria that human mathematicians often use to evaluate conjectures which might itself prove to be some emergent feature that reveals some new and more efficient way of finding truths and/or for guiding explorations given what we know now etc., for example by providing insights into which types of models or metrics or learning or optimization processes and methods etc. converge most rapidly or with highest accuracy.


2. **Scalable Oversight for Complex Proofs:** Mark Chen highlights the problem of "scalable oversight" â€“ how to ensure correctness when models generate complex outputs. In ACD, this could be addressed through a combination of formal proof verification, human review of key steps or abstractions in the generated proof, and the use of multiple independent agents to verify different aspects of the proof.

3. **AI-Generated Counter-Examples:** LLMs could be trained to generate counter-examples to conjectures. This is a valuable skill in mathematics and could enhance ACD's ability to refine and validate conjectures.  The LLM could generate potential counterexamples, and EADS could generate code to test whether they actually invalidate the conjecture and thus further evaluate those narratives or provide feedback to other agent networks and so on.

4. **Interactive Visualization of Multi-Agent Dynamics:** Develop interactive visualizations that show not only the "narrative space" of conjectures but also the interactions between agents. This would help researchers understand how the multi-agent system is exploring the mathematical landscape and where human intervention is needed etc., particularly for those cases of 'tunnel-narratives' or outlier or similarly anomalous properties or features within these dynamically evolving systems whose behavior is extremely difficult for traditional methods due to the extremely complex hyperspace topologies that emerge. This could further provide entirely new avenues for researchers to investigate using such systems, whose output will need human guidance but whose potential is vast and nearly limitless, or at least far beyond our current capabilities to solve those aforementioned problems etc., like modeling extremely complex and/or dynamic phenomena in theoretical or experimental physics or for biological or other science domains etc., such as the examples described earlier.


5. **BCI for Intuitive Mathematical Exploration:**  While speculative, explore the potential of using a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) to enable direct human interaction with the "narrative space."  This could amplify human intuition and facilitate the discovery of non-obvious patterns or relationships. While BCI technology isn't sufficiently developed yet, considering how it might be integrated with CNS and ACD provides valuable insights into the potential of future human-AI collaboration.

By incorporating these new methods, addressing the identified challenges, and continually refining the system's design and implementation based on experimental feedback and scientific rigor, the ACD project can make significant progress toward automating mathematical discovery and augmenting human creativity in mathematics and the sciences.  Remember, documentation, collaboration, and careful evaluation are crucial for success.
