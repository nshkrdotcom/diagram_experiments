How To Study Ambient Space - ASE - Ambient Space Explorer

Grounding in Physical Reality: ASE connects directly to the physical world, learning from sensor data, spatial relationships, and real-world interactions. This offers a way to discover mathematical structures embedded within physical phenomena, a more direct link between mathematics and the natural world. This could lead to the discovery of mathematical or geometric analogues representing causal or similarly non-obvious or multi-level types of complex interaction whose characteristics become more prominent once the data's underlying structure is captured correctly.

Embodied Cognition: ASE aligns with the embodied cognition perspective: intelligence is shaped by how an agent interacts with its environment and observes its effect on those local embeddings, similar to our earlier discussion of measuring differences through chiral-gradient descent, but with multi-level spatiotemporal feedback loops informing not just where our agents are in those higher-dimensional spaces during descent towards T etc., but how those positions affect the space they move through given a time component, such as if there are ripple effects from that change that emerge over various temporal distances or intervals. These could affect both the local trajectory of nearby narratives as they too perform their own descent and also could feed back directly or non-locally to some other narrative or layer or network from which another form of gradient- or meta- information is used during these refinements at these different layers such as has been discussed elsewhere, especially when combined with those earlier multi-agent network proposals we discussed where some oracle of trust is defined based on each individual agent's models' assessment, perhaps influenced further based on consensus by other similar independent orthogonal networks or embeddings at different temporal or other similar metrics whose utility become evident after further testing or by finding such evidence during experimental trials etc. as just one possible path.

Dynamic and Adaptive Models: Ambient space is constantly changing. ASE must be dynamic and adaptive, updating its representations in real-time. This could lead to new mathematical models of dynamic systems, capturing the evolution of structures and patterns over time and also their spatial locations. For instance, consider what new kinds of topologies or fractal features emerge using that kind of dataset in a dynamic weather or other similar agent model where emergent features in the embedding hypergraph are used to train higher levels or are provided as feedback by or between other agents and their networks at each epoch.

Beyond Human Perception: Sensors capture information beyond human perception (e.g., infrared, ultraviolet, microscopic, macroscopic). ASE can discover mathematical structures hidden within these imperceptible realms. In doing so, it further provides additional insights from which our research hypotheses themselves now can iterate toward higher convergence as those new facts emerge and/or as our own perceptions about truth change, especially as those change to better match reality in those systems with verifiable, testable measures and results for such investigations.

The Ambient Space Explorer (ASE):

Multi-Sensor Data Acquisition: The system continuously collects data from diverse sensors capturing various aspects of ambient space (e.g., cameras, microphones, lidar, accelerometers, scientific instruments, IoT data streams).

BCI for Spatiotemporal Digest Stream and Feature Projection Interface:

Instead of directly visualizing ambient space (which is impossible given current technology etc., particularly with that high dimensionality for anything useful), create a mapping between features extracted using AI trained on those massive ambient datasets as input vectors, then evaluated using some set of chiral and orthogonal relationships relative to that high dimensional truth vector, then project those feature spaces and dynamics as our target data streams which is used to create a low-bandwidth but meaningful and potentially very useful view on ambient space for human perception using your multi-layered truth concept with spatiotemporal digest verification and consensus building from multiple sources or agents to enhance trust and accuracy, thus guiding user attention towards those areas of hyperspace where novel narratives and higher levels of truths are likely to emerge. These data or feature sets themselves form our truth vector when normalized or embedded such that our models now converge toward some understanding that corresponds with how our real world works in this framework where these metrics now describe real-world observables if our models conform or have other well defined relationships using our existing theories or models for these same systems or simulations or phenomena to provide feedback.

ASE Network and Model Ensemble: ASE isn't a single model but a system, including:

Deep Learning Models: Extract features from sensor data, capturing spatial and temporal patterns for example, and could potentially suggest hypotheses, experiments or guide explorations etc. by analyzing emergent properties using measures described elsewhere from which new and insightful observations arise or are predicted through causal inference from what is now known from combining multiple, potentially highly divergent perspectives towards better shared understanding across these or other research domains for which this system and theoretical or modeling framework is applied to enhance exploration or generate scientific consensus through similar methods etc., at least ideally.

Geometric and Topological Analysis Modules: Analyze the shape and structure of extracted patterns. Topological Data Analysis, persistent homology etc., when applied to these high dimensional data streams or spaces generated using similar networks will help evaluate their causal structures, which will be important to understand before claiming any breakthroughs etc. since the properties such as those found using chirality could arise through coincidental relationships or merely be some form of emergent artifact due to the very complex nature of these multi-level multi-agent learning systems and so on and would therefore merit significant research and rigor in the form of tests like those proposed elsewhere to either strengthen and/or validate those findings or disprove, adjust and or refine in the pursuit of novel understanding of such complex and fascinating systems and the mathematical and physical structures their emergent behaviours and structures begin to reveal during their explorations and convergence towards those shared goals and those truths they help to generate etc.

Dynamic Bayesian Networks: Model the evolution of ambient space over time, capturing probabilistic relationships between events and phenomena as a stream of narrative inputs into these layers and evaluated by other agents using existing models as before, such as LLMs or deep learning agents where the metrics associated with convergence etc. remain useful for how we decide whether such narratives warrant higher-order investigation, belief or trust based on the consensus etc. we previously described.

Conjecture Synthesis Engine: This engine synthesizes mathematical conjectures based on:

Feature embeddings, their emergent topologies and relationships that become apparent.

Detected patterns and their geometric or topological interpretations from ASE output. These become "proto-conjectures," expressed in some interim structure prior to converting to narrative form if done as a separate step or by some other sub-agent that specializes in mapping to narrative embeddings as we described elsewhere.

LLM-Powered Formalization (Gemini): Gemini refines proto-conjectures, translating them into formal mathematical language and generating candidate formulas, expressions, equations, theorems or similar structures in other accepted domains like chemical reactions and so on as determined useful or valid within the criteria established by human researchers for the current research focus etc.

Interactive Refinement and Validation (BCI): The human interacts with the system, exploring conjectures visually, and through multi-modal interaction, similar to what you first proposed. These actions, such as narrative-space manipulation to create higher-order representations are observed by the models to infer what properties or states of T are implied and generate new hypotheses using feedback from LIME to further adjust trajectories based on which regions of the narrative or hyperspace seem most likely given various levels of local/non-local topology and consensus etc. and also based on the system's past success for that type of task, etc. to create some kind of weighted probability assessment and refine the fitness functions.

What Makes ASE Revolutionary:

ASE not only automates aspects of mathematical discovery but grounds that process in the physical world through this novel idea of using embedded models in this multi-agent, adversarial framework which incorporates many potentially divergent and conflicting and/or orthogonal and complementary approaches to discovery at scale. It bridges the gap between observation, intuition, and formalization. It allows humans to "see" the unseen through data streams extracted from sensors, opening up vast new realms for mathematical exploration and discovery, with the potential to discover completely new connections, for instance across scientific and other research fields based on their shared or unshared characteristics of narratives embedded into a common representational space or 'narrative-space' or hyperspace and so on.

The key innovations are:

The dynamic, adaptive nature of ASE.

The focus on topological, geometric features of ambient data when defining or inferring truth or other higher order properties.

The powerful synergy of sensor data, deep learning, symbolic computation, LLMs, evolutionary algorithms, and human intuition mediated using BCI interface technology to reduce the complexity for human analysis of very high-dimensional state spaces and those patterns and emergent features our agents discover there.

There are many unexplored hypotheses to evaluate from what we already know etc. and using some simple datasets from the open-source or academic communities to do our first experimental and controlled tests for these proposals, where scientists themselves assess the quality of discoveries that the system and its methods reveal using these measures and scoring algorithms based on your concept of chiral and or orthogonal narrative synthesis with these novel methods using local and non-local geometric properties such as network topology characteristics like node degrees etc. and confidence, where trust emerges in some demonstrable or verifiable form such as if and/or when some novel discovery converges quickly across multiple narratives to prove some scientific fact given some known truth. This may not even be its goal, it could also improve how we do exploration of high dimensional feature spaces etc. and improve experimental research efficiency, assuming these multi-agent systems where networks also interact and evolve according to some higher-order dynamic emergent system and can therefore represent such systems more correctly and from which validatable hypothesis arise or their models reveal which experiments have higher probabilities of uncovering ground truth using existing metrics or suggest which paths lead toward refinement or replacement of their or our models or what new information we still require to converge more rapidly given whatever constraints or metrics and methods etc. which define our current understanding.
