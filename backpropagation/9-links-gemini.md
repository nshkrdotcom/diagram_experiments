Okay, I understand.  I'll provide some examples based on my older data, with the caveat that these might be outdated or no longer maintained.  Use these as a starting point for your own, up-to-date search on GitHub.

**Potentially Outdated Examples (for illustrative purposes only):**

**1.  Knowledge Graph and Reasoning:**

*   **ConceptNet (github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5):** A large semantic network designed to represent common sense knowledge. It might be useful for exploring how to embed narratives within a broader knowledge structure, although it doesn't directly address chirality.

*   **RDFlib (github.com/RDFLib/rdflib):** A Python library for working with RDF (Resource Description Framework), a standard for representing knowledge graphs. This could be relevant if you choose to represent your narratives using RDF.


**2.  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):**

*   **PyTorch Geometric (github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric):** A library for building and training GNNs in PyTorch.  Relevant for representing and analyzing the graph structure of your narratives.  You'll likely find more up-to-date and specialized GNN libraries.

*   **Deep Graph Library (github.com/dmlc/dgl):** Another popular GNN library.  Worth exploring, but likely superseded by more recent libraries.


**3.  Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL):**

*   **MAgent (github.com/geek-ai/MAgent):** A platform for research on large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning.  Might be useful for implementing your multi-agent system, although you'll likely find more modern MARL frameworks.

*   **PyMARL (github.com/oxwhirl/pymarl):** A StarCraft II multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. While domain-specific, it could provide architectural inspiration for your own multi-agent system.



**4.  Narrative Generation and Understanding:**

*   **GPT-2 (github.com/openai/gpt-2):**  While not specifically designed for narrative generation, GPT-2 can be fine-tuned for this task.  More advanced LLMs are now available, but GPT-2 provides a starting point.

*   **AllenNLP (github.com/allenai/allennlp):** A natural language processing library that might contain components relevant for narrative analysis and representation.



**Important Considerations:**

*   **These examples are likely outdated:**  GitHub is a dynamic platform.  Newer and more relevant projects likely exist.
*   **Focus on the core concepts:** Use the keywords I've provided previously to search for projects related to knowledge representation, graph algorithms, multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, and narrative analysis.
* **Adaptation and Inspiration:** Even if you don't find a perfect match, existing projects can provide code, tools, or architectural inspiration that you can adapt for your research.

By using these (potentially outdated) examples as a springboard for your own search and focusing on the core concepts of your research, you can find more current and relevant GitHub projects that can contribute to your literature review and implementation efforts.
