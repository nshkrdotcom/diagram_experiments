\section{Bayesian Narrative Representation}

A narrative $N_i$ is represented as a conditional probability distribution over world states $W$:

\[
N_i \equiv P(W|N_i)
\]

\section{Narrative Synthesis}

The synthesis of two narratives $N_i$ and $N_j$ is represented as a Bayesian update:

\[
Synth(N_i, N_j) = N_k \equiv P(W|N_i, N_j)
\]

Assuming conditional independence between narratives given the world state, and given a uniform prior $P(W)$, we have:
\[P(W|N_i, N_j) \propto P(W|N_i) P(W|N_j) \]


\section{Chirality and Orthogonality}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Chirality:}  Two narratives $N_i$ and $N_j$ are chiral if their probability distributions have high divergence (e.g., measured by KL or JS divergence).
    \item \textbf{Orthogonality:} Two narratives $N_i$ and $N_j$ are orthogonal if they have low mutual information about the world state $W$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conjectures}

\begin{conjecture}[Bayesian Narrative Synthesis]
If $N_i$ and $N_j$ are two narratives with confidence scores $T_i$ and $T_j$ respectively, then the confidence score $T_k$ of the synthesized narrative $N_k = Synth(N_i, N_j)$ satisfies:
\[
T_k \ge \max(T_i, T_j)
\]
\end{conjecture}

\begin{conjecture}[Chiral Narrative Convergence]
If $N_i$ and $N_j$ are chiral narratives with high divergence, their synthesis $N_k$ will converge faster towards the truth $T$ compared to the individual narratives.
\end{conjecture}

\begin{conjecture}[Orthogonal Narrative Complementarity]
If $N_i$ and $N_j$ are orthogonal narratives with low mutual information, their synthesis $N_k$ will have a higher confidence score than either individual narrative:
\[
T_k > \max(T_i, T_j)
\]
\end{conjecture}
