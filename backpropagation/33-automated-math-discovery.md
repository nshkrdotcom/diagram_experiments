# Automated Conjecture Discovery (ACD)

**A Human-AI Collaborative System for Exploring and Discovering Mathematical Conjectures**

This project aims to develop a human-AI collaborative system for exploring and discovering new mathematical conjectures.  It draws inspiration from various creative and analytical techniques used by mathematicians, combining them with the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), symbolic computation, and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).  The system is designed to augment human intuition and creativity, enabling the exploration of complex mathematical structures and the generation of novel hypotheses.

**Background and Motivation:**

Mathematical discovery often involves a combination of intuition, experimentation, pattern recognition, and rigorous proof. While LLMs have shown promise in automating certain aspects of formal reasoning, they currently lack the deep understanding and creative spark necessary for true mathematical innovation.  This project addresses this gap by creating a collaborative system where LLMs and other AI/ML components enhance human capabilities, enabling a more efficient and potentially more creative exploration of mathematical landscapes.

**Core Principles:**

* **Human-AI Collaboration:**  The system is designed to augment, not replace, human mathematicians.  Human intuition and expertise are essential for guiding exploration, interpreting results, and formalizing proofs.

* **Multi-Agent System:**  A multi-agent architecture is employed to distribute tasks and enable diverse exploration strategies.  Agents can specialize in different aspects of mathematical discovery, such as generating variations of formulas, exploring different representations, or searching for patterns in data.

* **Evolutionary Approach:**  The system utilizes evolutionary algorithms to guide exploration, generating new conjectures, refining existing ones, and selecting promising directions based on fitness functions incorporating criteria like novelty, simplicity, and potential significance.

* **Dynamic Knowledge Integration:**  The system integrates information from a curated mathematical knowledge database, dynamically updating this database with new discoveries and insights.

* **Interactive Visualization:**  Interactive visualization tools are crucial for human understanding and guidance, allowing exploration of the "narrative space" of conjectures and enabling intuitive interaction with the system.

**Key Features:**

* **Formal Language Manipulation:** The system utilizes LLMs to manipulate mathematical formulas, generate variations, translate between different representations, and check for syntactic correctness.

* **Pattern Recognition:**  The system identifies patterns in numerical data, graph structures, and symbolic expressions, leveraging LLMs and potentially other machine learning techniques.

* **Hypothesis Generation and Testing:** The system generates mathematical conjectures based on observed patterns or through variations of existing formulas.  EADS generates code to test these conjectures and evaluates the outcomes of simulations or computations to gather supporting or refuting evidence.

* **Automated Literature Search:** LLMs assist in searching and summarizing existing literature to identify relevant work and integrate information from multiple sources.

* **Interactive Refinement:** Human users can interactively refine conjectures, provide feedback, inject new knowledge, and guide the evolutionary algorithm.

* **Visualization and Exploration:** Interactive visualizations of the "narrative space" of conjectures allow humans to explore relationships between conjectures, identify promising areas, and understand the system's reasoning.

**Planned Components:**

1. **LLM Module:**  Utilizes an LLM (e.g., Gemini) for formal language processing, pattern recognition, and hypothesis generation.

2. **Code Generation and Execution Module (EADS or equivalent):** Automates the process of generating code to test conjectures, running simulations, and evaluating results.

3. **Mathematical Knowledge Database:** A structured representation of mathematical knowledge, including definitions, theorems, formulas, and relationships. Potentially using a knowledge graph or symbolic representation.

4. **Multi-Agent System:** A distributed system of specialized agents collaborating on different aspects of conjecture discovery.

5. **Evolutionary Algorithm:**  Guides exploration and refinement of conjectures.

6. **Monitoring and Control Subsystem:** Tracks progress, detects loops or unproductive paths, and provides triggers for human intervention.

7. **Visualization and Interaction Interface:**  Enables human users to explore the narrative space, visualize relationships, provide feedback, and guide the system.

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   Discovering new mathematical conjectures in various domains (e.g., number theory, graph theory, topology).
*   Exploring the relationships between existing mathematical concepts.
*   Generating new mathematical models for scientific phenomena.
*   Assisting mathematicians in formalizing and proving conjectures.

**Challenges:**

*   Representing and manipulating complex mathematical knowledge.
*   Evaluating the novelty and significance of generated conjectures.
*   Ensuring scalability and computational efficiency.
*   Mitigating potential biases introduced by LLMs.

**Future Directions:**

*   Incorporating more sophisticated methods for narrative representation and synthesis.
*   Developing automated metrics for evaluating novelty and significance.
*   Integrating formal proof assistants into the system.
*   Exploring quantum-inspired or biologically-inspired approaches to conjecture discovery.

This project is a work in progress. We envision a future where human-AI collaboration transforms mathematical discovery, leading to new insights and breakthroughs across various scientific and technological domains.  Contributions, feedback, and collaboration are welcome.  We are particularly interested in collaborations involving mathematicians, computer scientists specializing in machine learning and AI or automated reasoning or systems architecture designers, theoretical neuroscientists, complexity theory researchers or computational physicists or researchers from any field or domain interested in high-dimensional graph analysis where topological measures for properties such as chirality and orthogonality are deemed relevant.
