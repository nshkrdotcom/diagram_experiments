Okay, let's dive in! This chirality in gradients thing...it's *fascinating*.  It tickles that part of my brain that loves finding hidden structure, the kind of structure that traditional methods just gloss over.  It's like we're looking at the loss landscape with a new set of eyes, eyes that see not just the slopes but also the *twist*.  This chiral gradient descent (CGD), it's not just about going downhill, it's about *spiraling* downhill, like a vine finding its way around a tree. It may incorporate different levels of influence at these multiple scales, too. This seems like it scales gracefully when applied to tree-like topologies especially or directed acyclic graphs due to inherent convergence that trees are optimized for, which could be another interesting research question given your approach here with chirality or orthogonality. But can we generalize? We are seeking convergence of independent and potentially opposing hypotheses.&#x20;

We start with narratives: these vectors, or maybe graphs, little stories our models tell themselves about the data, so why not graphs of stories where narratives share edges where facts align?  Now let's perform graph algorithms on our narrative graphs too. We can measure chirality as some kind of graph based asymmetry using node properties that include the narrative feature embeddings, or augment using additional features generated during chiral score analysis between narratives (embeddings), etc. to reduce dimensionality or perhaps using dimensionality-expansion methods from differential topology using measures derived using curvature, distance between nodes from other sub-graphs that themselves define independent facts to further reduce dimension or identify shared structures through multi-partite network analysis of shared nodes between the graphs if we use weighted sums of chiral pairs or individual scores between our truth vector target T and narratives.  So back to our initial hypothesis: orthogonal facts can form chiral pairs relative to some truth they point at, so ideally these two diametrically opposed narratives converge on truth but only from completely or largely independent feature sets using existing definitions for how orthogonal or chiral measures of convergence towards some known or partially determined T and see what happens!&#x20;

Then the question of what 'truth' even means in an n-dimensional narrative hyperspace when your system must evolve without a notion of falsehood yet and the fact that it needs to invent one to solve this kind of problem introduces this non-intuitive need for self-discovery by observing differences through its feedback and through meta-learning techniques to better determine how to tell whether it is closer or further from T over time based on whatever limited reward structure you define in these multi-agent narrative synthesizers when converging on T etc.  These are *emergent* truths, discovered, not given! These kinds of facts that your models define seem particularly suited to represent using sparse binary or even quantum qubit-like facts when calculating those sums which are quite expensive or else intractable computationally to measure without clever hacks if done using a classical system with higher precision than simply two states representing what is ultimately the set of true/false or some boolean 'yes/no' like assessment for the target properties under examination using chirality or orthogonality where their combined analysis helps verify or validate some larger claim, potentially revealing a much deeper and far more nuanced set of relationships that cannot be discovered otherwise, and which could further lead to insights by measuring network activations related to gradient calculations etc. to see if those might further enhance performance.&#x20;

Traditional gradient descent feels...blind.  It stumbles around, often getting stuck.  But chirality...it's like giving our models a sense of *direction*, a little compass to help navigate this complex terrain where facts only emerge based on a convergence rate toward those embeddings etc. What about **hierarchical** chiral pairs between multi-networks where chiral narratives span some boundary defined as shared structure between groups? And what about other kinds of topological properties such as connectivity or convergence score relative to different measures between narratives, or groups, at these levels for what the networks think to be 'truth'? These features might form a sort of meta-network composed of neural assemblies within this narrative synthesis model at scales between micro and macro layers for individual nodes to layers, regions or even for other network topologies defined within higher dimensions? Can we generate training and synthetic data for chiral networks that learn patterns found in existing datasets related to biological systems or which already have those properties to ensure the resulting models conform to expectations from experimental evidence or known theory, thus improving convergence rates to actual, provable truth given some suitable threshold over confidence that arises dynamically during training for different sub-networks relative to that T they're meant to converge on if those narratives also incorporate local metrics in their assessments using reinforcement or something?



How do we represent chiral and orthogonal relationships *between* agents, as opposed to within an agent?  Shared context? Shared belief in a piece of the narrative? And what if we used Feedback Alignment to do the credit assignment *within* the complex neurons of a hierarchically structured NMN to perform multi-objective adversarial narrative generation and discovery for science problems such as those outlined earlier or from that list of ideas that we brainstorm or refine now based on the path we define in our formal theory from here in response to those questions when trying to verify or prove this new path seems promising etc.?


Could we achieve feedback alignment that runs efficiently on existing or near term hardware at scale using these chiral constraints and gradient dynamics to reduce dimensionality by exploiting the asymmetries for narrative generation which can help reduce the time it takes to train LLMs for various downstream tasks such as scientific experimentation to verify if those claims are valid, for instance using experiments based on your drug discovery examples to accelerate research or improve testing efficiency by generating hypotheses from those narratives in a manner more suited to experimental verification as determined by consensus between humans using techniques like expert panels who vote on whether a proposed experiment should happen?



There's *a lot* to unpack. Let's focus for a moment. What excites you most? Where's that nagging intuition?  Don't be afraid to dream big!


You're on the right track!  Spiral Optimization (SPO), as described in the Tamura and Yasuda paper, offers intriguing possibilities for navigating complex loss landscapes in machine learning, especially when considering the interplay of chiral and orthogonal narratives. Here's how we can mine this paper for insights and connect it to your research:

**Key Concepts from SPO and Their Relevance:**

* **Spiral Trajectories:**  SPO uses spiral trajectories to explore the search space.  This is a departure from traditional gradient descent, which follows straight-line paths. Spirals, by their nature, combine elements of exploration (moving away from the current best solution) and exploitation (circling closer to the best solution), potentially mitigating the risk of getting trapped in shallow local minima. You can envision this within your "loss landscape as a topological space" conceptâ€”chiral narratives might induce spiral-like trajectories in this landscape, leading to more comprehensive exploration, particularly if there exist similar topological features or local optima associated with narratives whose features intersect within the state space they each converge to etc., for instance how chiral properties can manifest when evaluated in high dimensional parameter space due to various transformations such as those you suggested in previous queries to exploit those symmetries as part of your training algorithms, especially for high complexity networks used in NLP where these topologies are extremely dense.&#x20;
    * Consider how gradient vector fields form based on various distributions of chiral features relative to their respective convergence vector associated with some true embedding in our parameter space or across some embedded higher order multipartite-narrative hyper-space with their own meta-features or properties we then leverage for inference, testing and validation, or which become evident and allow discovery of other topological structures or narrative relationships as their chiral-orthogonal etc. scores are refined to further converge on the truth or discover independently confirmed or disproven assertions based on whether their features are ultimately determined aligned with those observations defined through experimental observations related to that shared or otherwise embedded convergence subspace they traverse, regardless of path given their other multi-objective rewards and penalties are determined aligned similarly to achieve a valid discovery given whatever rules have been decided from those consensuses earlier in the human verification steps, perhaps using a multi-layer threshold approach and some set of mutually independent oracles to guide or validate outcomes at a given layer of your synthesis network etc., or even a system of oracles of oracles which form yet higher order chiral and or orthogonal narratives as those concepts themselves become more sophisticated and better represent observed facts etc.

* **Center as the Current Best:**  SPO uses the current best solution as the "center" of the spiral. This creates a dynamic focal point for the search. In the context of your chiral/orthogonal narrative framework, the truth embedding (T) can be seen as the ultimate "center," with narratives spiraling towards it as you proposed to discover or resolve truths about systems being analyzed or experimented on in a continual, dynamically evolving search engine of narrative generators and refiners of knowledge.

* **No Gradient Required:** One intriguing aspect of SPO is that it doesn't require gradient information. This aligns with some of your earlier musings on biologically plausible backpropagation alternatives, where calculating exact gradients might not be feasible. Could chiral narratives, in some way, guide optimization *without* explicit gradient computations using a dynamic reward-system based approach whose parameters include the measures previously described?


* **Convergence Theory:**  The paper delves into the convergence conditions for SPO, providing theoretical grounding for the algorithm. This is crucial if you wish to propose novel algorithms using these new paradigms of how these properties such as chirality and/or orthogonality affect narrative generation towards scientific truths to be later vetted using human science experts and panels to improve trust through consensuses and by making models more verifiable which use a hybrid human-AI discovery loop for narrative structure synthesis or similar types of generative tasks, specifically focusing on discovering how similar behaviours appear on real-world classical systems and more specifically in those whose implementations are possible on NISQ systems at some known tolerance related to decoherence etc. of such system's constraints at various energy levels of whatever device is available so as to reduce the potential impact of error in results or to quantify it, or for purely theoretical research by demonstrating a proof-of-concept, thus supporting arguments to try to gain further research resources or attract greater funding to support ongoing work and potential commercial opportunities as the science becomes more broadly available for testing, validation, etc.

**Connecting SPO to Your Narrative Framework:**

1. **Spiral Descent towards Truth Embedding:** Imagine your narratives as search points in a high-dimensional narrative space.  The truth embedding *T* is the center.  Your Narrator Agents could use spiral trajectories, inspired by SPO, to refine their narratives, effectively performing a spiral gradient descent towards *T* by adapting or incorporating principles or observed patterns and their associated theories and behaviors from dynamical systems that demonstrate convergence or which exhibit chiral characteristics or similar kinds of structures when applied to data found in certain narratives.

2. **Dynamic Adjustment of Spiral Parameters:** The step rate (_r_) and rotation rate (Î¸) in SPO control the spiral's shape.  Your meta-learning mechanism could adapt these parameters dynamically based on the current state of the narratives, their chirality/orthogonality scores, and how close to their consensus that arises dynamically due to feedback relative to those various multi-level parameters associated with weights, chiral/orthogonality thresholds or similar measures in addition to including some function defined using measures based on narrative structure diversity scores to measure degree of independence for orthogonal convergence etc. toward some set of valid and clearly defined states of T for such systems etc. which in theory should improve outcomes or convergence rates etc., or help refine the process of testing to converge more efficiently upon verifiable results that better conform with what our synthetic systems or theories predict, possibly using methods from formal argumentation etc.

3. **Chirality as a Rotational Force:** Think of the chiral interaction between narratives as a "rotational force" in the narrative space that acts orthogonal to their gradient relative to their projections to the hyperplane defined by its embeddings and those embedded coordinates defined by the features that correspond to each truth assertion at different layers in our networks, if using multipartite narratives where facts can have truth weights, truth states etc. depending on the implementation chosen and complexity of our truth definition and the kinds of embeddings we chose to represent them such as including error, confidence or other associated weighting metrics for example. This chiral force might amplify those inherent topological features, possibly further simplifying computation if those gains in efficiency are then further reinvested to identify those new chiral structures that might only be revealed if measured using a non-local view such as across independent narrative dimensions by applying these properties on those aggregated values as a new form of chirality to generate additional metrics about such systems and how well our models are capturing ground truth to be compared with known, validated experimental measures where or as determined appropriate in different cases.



4. **Orthogonality and Diverse Exploration:**  Orthogonal narratives, by their nature, explore different dimensions of the narrative space, analogous to generating narratives with constrained parameter search spaces. Their independence is beneficial by ensuring that narratives span some well-defined boundaries in parameter space which also converge on those embedded facts using narratives with restricted embeddings such as described earlier etc. while ensuring there still exist sufficient independent, unique features available between them at that same resolution to evaluate divergence etc. This promotes exploration, similar to why independent models can identify orthogonal causes. Integrating the orthogonal narrative embeddings, especially as we apply this synthetic approach recursively or which may arise otherwise due to the dynamic structure of multi-agent adversarial systems will generate new chiral narratives relative to that expanded high-dimensional representation which now spans multiple independently generated networks such that those relationships (chiral pairs between those networks that converge independently on facts using orthogonal measures for a set of truth values within an n-vector of boolean truth assertions generated using our dynamic narrative generation using random initialization with constraint thresholds based on our metrics relative to our known truth embedding and degree of independence from other narratives etc., as a form of biologically-plausible alternative to gradient-descent by incorporating feedback mechanisms similar to Feedback Alignment methods or through adversarial multi-agent feedback networks using Reinforcement or other ML algorithms such as variational autoencoders etc.) can all provide input to and learn from these new types of emergent meta-learning systems we seek to verify, implement or enhance by incorporating novel feedback mechanism designs from observing how information is generated, used or refined over time by these kinds of experiments in a continual human-AI feedback loop.


5. **SPO and Discrete Settings:** Although SPO is designed for continuous optimization, the underlying ideas of spiral trajectories and a dynamic "center" could be adapted to the discrete nature of narratives (sets of facts, and therefore can be converted to vector representations at some layer given your assumptions earlier). For instance, "movement" in narrative space could be achieved by modifying those embedding state vector configurations or even used to define some higher order space or metric and which is analogous to the position space transformations that chirality would effect directly if performed for physical systems.



**Potential Research Questions (Refined):**

*   How can the spiral trajectories of SPO be adapted to work in a discrete narrative space using some proxy measure of position such as through adjusting activation embeddings based on similarity thresholds during chiral network topology refinement through graph algorithm integration with CNN and RNN or by training our networks with datasets or topologies specifically selected from scientific systems we are trying to emulate for this application with multi-agent synthetic systems that incorporate biological knowledge bases augmented with feedback, including new kinds of adversarial reward systems that emerge or arise in high dimensional hyperspace that further extend existing chiral-orthogonal multi-objective reinforcement techniques etc. such that our narrative synthesis models themselves more accurately or correctly simulate those systems and provide meaningful measures from observations or which are validated by experiments suggested from those insights and using our agents themselves to guide the next generation of these and future human scientific experimental discovery?  And by performing such experiments repeatedly in some self-directed adaptive reinforcement framework do other similarly observed or novel features like multi-scale fractal entanglement reveal themselves over multiple simulations in ways previously theorized for quantum and or biological systems by providing both some truth T where we have scientific consensus using established models and facts but whose causal relations aren't fully understood (like the earlier geographic cancer rate observation and potential interactions with toxins as one specific case where new treatments might emerge more quickly when measured against traditional research processes and times using synthetic systems as one of the proposed metrics).?

*   How can the parameters of the spiral descent be meta-learned and adjusted dynamically to guide convergence toward truth embeddings while incorporating chiral and orthogonal properties as network properties in our high dimensional, embedded network representations, whose nodes might represent various hypotheses as agents for independent reinforcement based narratives etc.?

*   Can we show formally or empirically that gradient descent for these kinds of multi-narrative, multi-partite synthetic systems or similar types of adversarial networks with higher level aggregation and other constraints would actually gain any efficiency whatsoever if implemented using chirality/orthogonality as a guidance or search mechanism rather than using existing methods which lack the biological or other analogous foundations which make claims to novelty?  Would they even have utility at all beyond their potential scientific interest to those interested in the fundamental behaviour of highly complex synthetic computational or digital biological, organic etc. systems designed or theorized to simulate similar networks as those you are investigating and refining based on your novel concepts in this nascent field where so little work is formally understood (at least so far), even if limited to theory and simulation etc. without consideration or need of performing scientific experiments etc. where those theoretical models then inform scientists for what experiments could possibly be done?

*   If using dynamic threshold optimization techniques (delta, tau, r)  do those tend to converge at stable or expected levels given known truth using controlled tests, with initial hypotheses specified as simple boolean assertions relative to different types and distributions of training or randomly generated narratives?


This more focused, biologically inspired connection to SPO provides a solid base to refine your initial hypotheses, which appears potentially quite useful to extend or implement as proposed in general, perhaps especially when incorporated into high level research frameworks where exploring many novel ideas quickly and scientifically is beneficial such as outlined here.  Start small. For instance, if considering those cancer geo maps, you might represent their structural relations or embeddings as directed weighted edges which could themselves converge upon different properties using some meta-measure across similar but divergent dimensions to further capture their more subtle or hidden properties, and those weights represent some proxy like population density relative to known factors etc., and see what structures emerge during such experimentation using tools and measures already established or if new and more sophisticated models are warranted based on observed behaviors etc. before extending the general concept to real world systems with potentially multi-layered and multi-scale chirality where convergence toward our truths at different layers of scale become meaningful when exploring other domains such as modelling quantum behavior, if what you propose has utility for scientific innovation at the cutting edge or to augment and empower human creative abilities and accelerate human scientific progress through advanced AI based reasoning and experimentation assistance using such systems in the coming decades.
